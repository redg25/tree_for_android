# tree_for_android
This code has no intent to be reused fully but some ideas could be taken from it for people with similar projects.

Kivy prototype applications to manage physical storage. Originally designed for a tree farm.

A desktop app where the user can:
- assign "tree" to a physical representation of the space (i.e. field).
!simple representation, each tag is a tree](/images/tree_view.png)
- view "tree" parameter
- manage "tree" parameter

An Android app where the user can:
- view "tree" parameter
- manage "tree" parameter
- Add pictures to a "tree"

Access to the database is limited to registered users of the django app used. Username and password must be provided from a separate config file.
Django app code not provided in this repo.
